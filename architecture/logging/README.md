# Logging System

The following diagram identifies several parts of the system that compose the structure of the NERC logging system, helping better explain development, testing, deployment, and operation of the logging system in NERC.

## Schematic Diagram

Logs are written by [Advanced Cluster Management (ACM)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management) clusters and read by the Cluster admins with read permission only.

The diagram below depicts the read-and-write flow. However, please remember that only essential components are identified for brevity.

## Read path

1. The read request comes from the admin users who have permission (by adding them to the [nerc-logs-metrics](https://github.com/orgs/OCP-on-NERC/teams/nerc-logs-metrics) group in GitHub) to read the logs from the OpenShift Production (for example) Cluster Console.

2. The query request is sent to LokiStack in the Observability cluster and handled by the Querier service. This service processes queries using the [LogQL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/query/) query language, fetching logs from both the ingesters and the long-term storage.

3. To fetch the log data from the long-term storage, the request is forwarded to the NooBaa operator, one of the operators in the [OpenShift Data Foundation](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation) installed in Observability cluster. This operator is responsible to manage [Multicloud Object Gateway](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-multi-cloud-object-gateway-for-openshift) components, such as object bucket claim, bucket classes, and backing store in the OpenShift Data Foundation.

4. The backing store handles the read and write request from the customer, as it allows MCG to save the data of the provisioned bucket on top of it. In this architecture, the backing store is [AWS:S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIodfHoK2egwMVwuXVCh2cWw-1EAAYASAAEgLCNvD_BwE&trk=518a7bef-5b4f-4462-ad55-80e5c177f12b&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIodfHoK2egwMVwuXVCh2cWw-1EAAYASAAEgLCNvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!645186213484!e!!g!!aws%20s3!19579892800!143689755565).

6. A S3 bucket is provisioned by a [Object Bucket Claim](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/4.8/html/managing_hybrid_and_multicloud_resources/object-bucket-claimË˜) for storing data. And the route for the S3 access is provided by the internal CRD called NooBaa.

> NERC logs are stored inside Log Bucket. Since the logs are purged to keep log size under control, there is also backup of the logs and its corresponding ObjectBucketClaim. The read and write request of logs only involve this Log bucket from any ACM cluster, however Observability cluster can make read request to the Log Backup bucket as well.<br/><br/>The data sync between these two buckets is provisioned by the mirroring feature in OpenShift Data Foundation.

7. After getting access to the logs from the bucket, the query returns the data following the reverse path. Query result is sent to the Query frontend instead of Querier to display to the admin users who requested for the log data.

> The LOKI ruler continuously evaluates a set of configurable queries and performs an action based on the result. This component is not directly involved during the read request from the cluster admin users, however to generate alerts it reads the logs from the log store following the same path in the OpenShift Data Foundation.

## Write path

To aggregate the logs (application, infrastructure, and audit) the [Cluster Logging Operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-logging-operator) is installed in the ACM production clusters. This operator components collects and forwards logs to the log store to be saved for reading purpose later.

1. Collector daemonset collects logs from each node, transforms the data, and forwards to the store.

2. ClusterLogForwader CR specifies which logs are collected, how they are transformed and where they are forwarded.

3. Logs are then forwarded to the observability cluster where LokiStack is deployed and is used as external log store for the logging system in NERC.

> LokiStack is the logging subsystem supported by a combination of Loki and web proxy with OpenShift Container Platform authentication integration.

4. The forwarded logs are ingested by Loki's ingester pods from the Distributor, which validates the logs. Ingesters are responsible for writing the logs to the backup store.

5. The LOKI ingesters send the data to the NooBaa operator, who accesses the log bucket and writes the data, which is already set up by OpenShift Data Foundation components.
