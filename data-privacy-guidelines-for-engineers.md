# Document data privacy guidelines for engineering teams to use during installation

The [Harvard Information Security Quick Reference Guide](https://security.harvard.edu/files/it-security/files/infosecquickguide20170920.pdf) provides a good overview of the security classification levels in a handout form, with links to further details. For completeness' sake, the [BU's Data Classification Policy](https://www.bu.edu/policies/data-classification-policy/) has corresponding levels.

For Server projects, the [Harvard University Security Policy: Working with Servers](https://policy.security.harvard.edu/all-servers) document captures security requirements. [BU's Minimum Security Standards](https://www.bu.edu/policies/minimum-security-standards/) provide comparable details.

Based on Scott's feedback above the data we are discussing is HDSL level 2.

The specific details for working with servers broadly are here [Information Security Policy-Working with Servers (2 pages)](https://policy.security.harvard.edu/all-servers) and these apply for [Servers with Level 2 Data](https://policy.security.harvard.edu/level-2#widget-2).

As per [BU's FERPA FAQ ](https://www.bu.edu/reg/academics/ferpa/faqs/)and [HU's FERPA FAQ ](https://gsas.harvard.edu/registration/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa#directory)email adresses are not protected. This is different, potentially then GDPR.
